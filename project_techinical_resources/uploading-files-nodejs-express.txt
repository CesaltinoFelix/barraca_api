Note: see the tutorial to implement more feactures on our API.

Here is what each of the above packages does:

#express - Popular web framework built on top of Node.js. We shall use it for developing REST API.
#body-parser - Node.js request body parsing middleware parses the incoming request body before your handlers and makes it available under the req.body property. In short, it simplifies incoming requests.
#cors - Another Express middleware for enabling CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) requests.
#express-fileupload - Simple Express middleware for uploading files. It parses multipart/form-data requests, extracts the files if available, and makes them available under the req.files property.
#morgan - Node.js middleware for logging HTTP requests.
#lodash - A JavaScript library that provides utility functions for arrays, numbers, objects, strings, etc.
